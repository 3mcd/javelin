# `@javelin/core`

This package is a general catch-all for stuff shared by many Javelin packages, including:

- a data model that can describe complex objects with two variants: user-friendly schema definitions and code-friendly graphs
- utils/helpers shared between all Javelin packages
- object pools

In general, you should not consume this package directly as its exports may change without notice. However, it might still prove useful, just use at your own risk!
