# `@javelin/core`

This package is a general catch-all for stuff shared by many Javelin packages, including:

- a data model with two uses:
  - user-friendly schema definitions
  - code-friendly object graphs (trees)
- object pools
- utils/helpers shared between all Javelin packages

In general, you should not consume this package directly as its exports may change without notice. However, it might still prove useful, just use at your own risk!
