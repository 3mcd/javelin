All data within a Javelin game is stored in components. Components are just plain objects; unremarkable, other than one reserved field: `type` â€” a unique integer that classifies the component. Components of the same shape should also share a `type`.

The `type` field establishes the taxonomy that Javelin uses to correctly store and retrieve components. Take the following example.

```typescript
// Bad!
const position = { type: 0, x: 2, y: 2 }
const health = { type: 0, value: 100 }
```

As we'll see later, this would result in catastrophic behavior of your application. Wherever you might be working with an entity's position component, there's a chance you could have a health object instead!

Just make the types unique:

```typescript
// <3
const position = { type: 0, ... }
const health = { type: 1, ... }
```

## Component Types

Unless you're trying to integrate with an existing codebase or library, it's recommended to use the `createComponentType` helper to define the component types your world will use. Component types make it easy to initialize components from a schema, and they can help produce components that are automatically pooled.

```typescript
import { createComponentType, number } from "@javelin/ecs"

const Position = createComponentType({
  type: 1,
  schema: {
    x: number,
    y: number,
  },
})
```

The component type **must** be registered using `world.registerComponentType` to take advantage of pooling:

```typescript
const world = createWorld({
  componentTypes: [Position],
})
// OR
world.registerComponentType(Position)
```

A component type has, at minimum, a type (discussed above) and **schema**.

### Schema

A component type's schema defines the field names and data types that make up the shape of the component. The schema is used to initialize component instances and reset them when they are detached.

The schema currently supports the following data types, which are each exported from `@javelin/ecs`:

- `number (0)`
- `boolean (false)`
- `string ("")`
- `array(number | boolean | string | array) ([])`

A default value for a data type can be specified in the schema by wrapping the data type in an object:

```typescript
schema: {
  x: { type: number, defaultValue: -1 }
}
```

### Creating components

Components can be initialized from component types via `world.component`:

```typescript
const position = world.component(Position)

position.x // 0
position.y // 0
```

You may also specify an initializer function for a component type to make component creation easier.

```typescript
const Position = createComponentType({
  // ...
  initialize(position, x = 0, y = 0) {
    position.x = x
    position.y = y
  },
})

const position = world.component(
  Position,
  10, // x
  20, // y
)

position.x // 10
position.y // 20
```

### Object Pooling

Components created via factory are automatically pooled. By default, the pool will initialize 10^3 components for usage, and will grow by the same amount when the pool shinks to zero. You can modify the pool size either by setting the `componentPoolSize` option on the config object passed to `createWorld()`, or when registering the component type with `world.registerComponentType`:

```typescript
const world = createWorld({
  componentPoolSize: 100,
})
// or
world.registerComponentType(Position, 10000)
```
