# javelin

Javelin is a collection of packages used to build multiplayer games for the web.

**Note** â€“ each package is an active work in progress and each minor release will likely introduce breaking changes prior to a 1.0 release.

The primary goals of Javelin are developer experience, performance, and a built-in networking protocol. A secondary goal is to provide examples of client-side prediction, input reconciliation, and other algorithms commonly used in fast-paced online games.

Javelin is comprised of an Entity-Component System (ECS) and an associated networking package used to synchronize game data between a client and server (or other clients).
